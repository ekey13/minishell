# Minishell

## Overview
`minishell` is a simplified shell program implemented in C, designed to replicate core functionalities of the UNIX shell. This project is part of the 42 School curriculum and aims to provide a deeper understanding of system calls, process management, and shell behavior.

---

## Features
- **Execution of commands**: Supports both built-in commands and external binaries.
- **Environment variable management**: Export, unset, and modify environment variables.
- **Redirections**: Input (`<`), output (`>`), and append (`>>`) redirections.
- **Pipes (`|`)**: Create pipelines to connect commands.
- **Signal handling**: Handles `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, and `Ctrl+\` to mimic bash behavior.
- **Built-in commands**:
  - `cd`: Change directory.
  - `echo`: Print messages to standard output.
  - `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
  - `export`: Set environment variables.
  - `unset`: Remove environment variables.
  - `env`: Display environment variables.
  - `exit`: Exit the shell.
